# Booty Dark Admin (Theme)
### What is Booty Dark Admin theme?

Booty Dark Admin (BDA) is an Admin Theme for Bludit Flat-file CMS.

Booty Dark Admin allows you to change individual elements of the admin sidebar and the Right Main pane.

There is also an add-on plugin to help you to change individual elements of your new admin theme. This plugin is not necessary but recommended. [See comparison below](https://github.com/tompidev/booty-dark-admin-theme#comparison-of-features).

No other add-ons are required to use the template.
